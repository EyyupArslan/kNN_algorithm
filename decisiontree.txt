 Project Title: Banknote Authentication using Decision Tree Classifier

 Project Description: This project aims to predict whether a banknote is genuine or fake using numerical features extracted from images of banknotes.
 The dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes 4 numerical attributes and 1 binary class label. A Decision Tree Classifier
 is used to perform the classification task.

 Dataset Information:

Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/267/banknote+authentication

File: data_banknote_authentication.txt

Features:

Variance of Wavelet Transformed image (Variance)

Skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (Skewness)

Curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (Curtosis)

Entropy of image (Entropy)

Class: 0 = Fake, 1 = Authentic

 Project Steps:

Load the dataset and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame.

Display the first few rows and statistical summary of the data.

Visualize feature combinations using scatter plots (pairwise).

Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split.

Train a Decision Tree Classifier:

Experiment with different parameters: max_depth, min_samples_split, criterion (gini/entropy).

Evaluate the model performance on the test set:

Use classification_report to obtain accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Plot a confusion matrix using ConfusionMatrixDisplay.

Visualize the trained decision tree using plot_tree.

Extract and plot feature importances using feature_importances_.

Analyze and comment on the suitability of decision trees for this dataset.

 Conclusion (Example Commentary): The dataset shows clear class separability, making Decision Tree a suitable model.
 The model performed well with high accuracy and interpretability. Visualizations (tree structure and feature importances) help us understand
 which attributes drive the decision. However, care must be taken to tune parameters (e.g., max_depth) to avoid overfitting.

 Tools & Libraries Used:

Python 3

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn (sklearn)

 Future Work:

Try other classification models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) for comparison

Use cross-validation and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

Deploy the model in a web app for demonstration
